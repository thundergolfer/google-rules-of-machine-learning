### Overview
**To make great products:**
*do machine learning like the great engineer you are, not like the great machine learning expert you aren’t.*

Most of the problems you will face are, in fact, engineering problems. Even with all the
resources of a great machine learning expert, most of the gains come from great features, not great machine learning algorithms.

So, the basic approach is:
1. make sure your pipeline is solid end to end
2. start with a reasonable objective
3. add common­sense features in a simple way
4. make sure that your pipeline stays solid.

This approach will make lots of money and/or make lots of people happy for a long period of time. Diverge from this approach only when there are no more simple tricks to get you any
farther. Adding complexity slows future releases.

Once you've exhausted the simple tricks, cutting­ edge machine learning might indeed be in your future. See the section on Phase III machine learning projects.

This document is arranged in four parts:
1. The first part should help you understand whether the time is right for building a machine
learning system.
2. The second part is about deploying your first pipeline.
3. The third part is about launching and iterating while adding new features to your pipeline,
how to evaluate models and training­serving skew.
4. The final part is about what to do when you reach a plateau.
5. Afterwards, there is a list of related work and an appendix with some background on the
systems commonly used as examples in this document.
